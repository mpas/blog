I am software geek and a hands on developer/system architect. Interested in all kinds of software related technologies (languages, architectures and methodologies). Strong believer in the fact that one should keep knowledge up-to-date, but also understand why you should choose a particular technology for a given problem.

Keeping knowledge up-to-date if fundamental and that is why regular visits to conferences like [QCon](http://www.qconferences.com/), [Devoxx](https://www.devoxx.com/), [BuildStuf](http://www.buildstuff.lt/) and various [Meetup communities](https://www.meetup.com/) are part of my working habbit. Supporting the developer community by organising the yearly [NextBuild Conference](http://www.nextbuild.nl) for Developers and by Developers.

Tech guy, wannabe cooking chef, traveller, likes to watch movies/series, beer enthusiast, tries to enjoy life.
